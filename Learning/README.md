1. [Cantor Pairing  & Trick](https://github.com/amangh30/dsa/blob/main/Learning/1.md)
   Description: This file demonstrates how we can map a pair (a,b) to a unique key & how can we store two numbers in one number

2. [Single Source Shortest Path](https://github.com/amangh30/dsa/blob/main/Learning/2.md)
   Description: This file demonstrates which algorithm to be used to find the shortest path from a single source to all other vertices in a graph.

3. [Ceil Formula Trick](https://github.com/amangh30/dsa/blob/main/Learning/3.md)
   Description: I mean bruhh, its literally what the topic says.

4. [Cycle Detection](https://github.com/amangh30/dsa/blob/main/Learning/4.md)
   Description: This file demonstrates how we can find cycle in a directed graph.

5. [Exhaustive Search](https://github.com/amangh30/dsa/blob/main/Learning/5.md)
   Description: When the answer lies in a *small known range**, a brute-force loop can efficiently solve the problem by checking all possible values.

6. [Binary/Fast Exponentiation](https://github.com/amangh30/dsa/blob/main/Learning/6.md)
   Description: Binary Exponentiation is an efficient algorithm to calculate the power of a number, especially useful for large exponents. It reduces the number of multiplication operations by breaking down the exponent into smaller, manageable parts.

7. [Dutch National Flag](https://github.com/amangh30/dsa/blob/main/Learning/7.md)
   Description: This file demonstrates the Dutch National Flag algorithm, which sorts an array of three distinct elements in linear time.

8. [Difference Array](https://github.com/amangh30/dsa/blob/main/Learning/8.md)
   Description: This file demonstrates the Difference Array algorithm, which is used to efficiently update and query ranges in an array.

9. [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://github.com/amangh30/dsa/blob/main/Learning/9.md)
   Description: This file demonstrates the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is used to efficiently find all prime numbers up to a given limit.
