# Square of a Sum identity

![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{150}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}C_{i}\right)^2=\sum_{i=1}^{n}C_{i}^2+2\sum_{1\leq{i}<j\leq{n}}C_{i}C_{j})

### How It Makes Sense

The equation works like calculating the area of a picture frame. 🖼️

1.  **The Big Square:** The `(Σc)²` term is the area of the **entire picture plus the frame**. It's one big area that includes everything.

2.  **The Unwanted Part:** The `Σ(c²)` term is the area of just the **picture in the middle**. We need to remove this part.

3.  **The Remainder:** When you subtract the picture from the total area, you're left with the area of the frame. This result is exactly **twice** the answer you need because of symmetry (e.g., a top part and a bottom part, a left and a right).

4.  **The Final Answer:** Dividing by **2** isolates the exact area you're looking for.


Basically suppose we are calculating the latter part, instead of the naive O(n<sup>2</sup>) approach, we can use this formula to get the ans in O(n)
