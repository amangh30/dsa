# Cycle Detection in Graph Algorithms

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

**Negative Cycles:**
- Yes, can detect negative cycles
- After running the algorithm, check if any diagonal entry `dist[i][i] < 0`
- This means there's a negative cycle that includes vertex i

**Positive Cycles:**
- Not directly designed to detect positive cycles
- The algorithm finds shortest paths, so positive cycles don't affect the shortest path calculation

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

**Negative Cycles:**
- Yes, specifically designed to detect negative cycles
- After |V|-1 iterations, perform one more iteration
- If any distance can still be improved, a negative cycle exists

**Positive Cycles:**
- Not directly detected
- Positive cycles don't affect the shortest path calculation
- Would require modification to detect

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Negative Cycles:**
- Cannot detect negative cycles
- Algorithm fails if negative edges exist
- Only works for graphs with non-negative edge weights

**Positive Cycles:**
- Cannot directly detect cycles
- Dijkstra's finds shortest paths from a single source
- Would need additional checks to detect cycles

## Key Differences:

1. **Negative Cycle Detection:**
   - Floyd-Warshall and Bellman-Ford can detect
   - Dijkstra cannot

2. **Positive Cycle Detection:**
   - None of these algorithms are designed for this
   - Would need to use DFS-based cycle detection

3. **Approach:**
   - Floyd-Warshall: All-pairs shortest paths
   - Bellman-Ford: Single-source with negative weights
   - Dijkstra: Single-source, non-negative weights only

For positive cycle detection, you'd typically use DFS with recursion stack tracking or topological sorting (for DAGs).
