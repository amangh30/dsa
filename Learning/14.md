# nth_element

`std::nth_element` in C++ partially sorts a range so that the element at the nth position is the one that would be there in a fully sorted range.

### Syntax:

```cpp
std::nth_element(first, nth, last);
std::nth_element(first, nth, last, comp);
```

### Behavior:

* Elements before `nth` are less than or equal to it.
* Elements after `nth` are greater than or equal to it.
* Not fully sorted.
* Think of it like quicksort.

### Example:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {4, 1, 7, 3, 8, 5};
    std::nth_element(v.begin(), v.begin() + 2, v.end());
    std::cout << v[2]; // Prints the 3rd smallest element
}
```

Efficient for finding k-th smallest/largest in linear time on average.
