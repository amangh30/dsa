# Shortest Path Algorithms: When to Use BFS, Dijkstra, or Bellman-Ford?

## 1. **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **When to Use:**
  - The graph is **unweighted** or all edges have the **same weight**.
- **Why?**
  - BFS explores nodes level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path (fewest edges) when all edges contribute equally to distance.
  - No need for priority queues → simpler and faster than Dijkstra.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - **O(V + E)** (optimal for unweighted/same-weight graphs).

## 2. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- **When to Use:**
  - The graph has **non-negative weights**, and you need the shortest path from a single source.
- **Why?**
  - Uses a **priority queue** to greedily select the closest unvisited node, ensuring correctness for non-negative weights.
  - Faster than Bellman-Ford when no negative edges exist.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - **O((V + E) log V)** (with a priority queue).

## 3. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**
- **When to Use:**
  - The graph **may have negative weights** or you need to detect **negative cycles**.
- **Why?**
  - Relaxes all edges repeatedly, handling negative weights (unlike Dijkstra).
  - Can detect negative cycles (unlike BFS/Dijkstra).
- **Time Complexity:**
  - **O(V × E)** (slower but more versatile).

### **Summary Table**
| Algorithm   | Best For                          | Handles Negative Weights? | Detects Negative Cycles? | Time Complexity  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **BFS**     | Unweighted / same-weight graphs  | ❌ No                    | ❌ No                    | O(V + E)         |
| **Dijkstra**| Weighted (non-negative) graphs   | ❌ No                    | ❌ No                    | O((V+E) log V)   |
| **Bellman-Ford**| Weighted (any), negative cycles | ✔️ Yes                  | ✔️ Yes                   | O(V × E)         |

> **Note:**
> - **BFS** is optimal for unweighted graphs.
> - **Dijkstra** is efficient for non-negative weights.
> - **Bellman-Ford** is the most flexible but slower.
