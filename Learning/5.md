# Brute-Force Search in Small Ranges (Exhaustive Search)

When the answer lies in a **small known range**, a brute-force loop can efficiently solve the problem by checking all possible values.

## When to Use:
- Range is **small** (e.g., 1–1000).
- No **mathematical shortcut** exists.
- Verification is **fast** for each candidate.

## Example:
Find `x` in `[1, 100]` such that `x² + 3x = 130`:

```python
for x in range(1, 101):
    if x*x + 3*x == 130:
        print(x)  # Output: 10
        break
