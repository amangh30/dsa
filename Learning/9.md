# Sieve of Eratosthenes in C++

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

void sieveOfEratosthenes(int n) {
    // Create a boolean array "prime[0..n]" and initialize all entries as true
    std::vector<bool> prime(n + 1, true);

    prime[0] = prime[1] = false; // 0 and 1 are not prime numbers

    for (int p = 2; p * p <= n; p++) {
        // If prime[p] is not changed, then it is a prime
        if (prime[p]) {
            // Update all multiples of p greater than or equal to p^2
            for (int i = p * p; i <= n; i += p) {
                prime[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Print all prime numbers
    std::cout << "Prime numbers up to " << n << " are:\n";
    for (int p = 2; p <= n; p++) {
        if (prime[p]) {
            std::cout << p << " ";
        }
    }
    std::cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    sieveOfEratosthenes(n);
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation:

1. We create a boolean vector `prime` where `prime[i]` indicates whether `i` is prime.
2. Initialize all entries as true, then mark 0 and 1 as non-prime.
3. For each number `p` starting from 2:
   - If `p` is still marked as prime, mark all its multiples as non-prime.
   - We start marking from `p*p` because smaller multiples of `p` would have already been marked by smaller primes.
4. After processing, all remaining true values in the array represent prime numbers.

## Optimization Notes:
- The outer loop runs only up to √n since all composite numbers ≤ n would have been marked by primes ≤ √n.
- We start marking multiples from `p*p` to avoid redundant work (smaller multiples would have been marked by smaller primes).

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n log log n), which is almost linear for large ranges.
