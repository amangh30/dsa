# Bit Manipulation

1. **Check if a number is even/odd**

   ```cpp
   bool isOdd = n & 1;
   ```

---

2. **Multiply by 2ⁿ**

   ```cpp
   int res = x << n;
   ```

---

3. **Divide by 2ⁿ**

   ```cpp
   int res = x >> n;
   ```

---

4. **Check if k-th bit is set**

   ```cpp
   bool isSet = (n & (1 << k)) != 0;
   ```

---

5. **Set the k-th bit**

   ```cpp
   n |= (1 << k);
   ```

---

6. **Clear the k-th bit**

   ```cpp
   n &= ~(1 << k);
   ```

---

7. **Toggle the k-th bit**

   ```cpp
   n ^= (1 << k);
   ```

---

8. **Count set bits**

   ```cpp
   int count = __builtin_popcount(n); // For 32-bit integers
   ```

---

9. **Check if n is power of 2**

   ```cpp
   bool isPow2 = n && !(n & (n - 1));
   ```

---

10. **Clear lowest set bit**

```cpp
n &= (n - 1);
```

---

11. **Get lowest set bit**

```cpp
int lsb = n & -n;
```

---

12. **Swap two numbers without temp**

```cpp
a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b;
```

---

13. **Turn off all bits after the rightmost set bit**

```cpp
n &= (n + 1);
```

---

14. **Turn on all bits after the rightmost unset bit**

```cpp
n |= (n - 1);
```
