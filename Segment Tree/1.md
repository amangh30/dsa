# Segment Tree

### When to Use?

Use a Segment Tree for fast range queries and updates on an array.

## Building it


```cpp
void buildSegmentTree(int i, int l, int r, vector<int>& segmentTree, int arr[]) {
    if(l == r) {
        segmentTree[i] = arr[l];
        return;
    }

    int mid = l + (r-l)/2;
    buildSegmentTree(2*i+1, l, mid, segmentTree, arr);
    buildSegmentTree(2*i+2, mid+1, r, segmentTree, arr);
    segmentTree[i] = segmentTree[2*i + 1] + segmentTree[2*i + 2];
}
```
* If `l == r`, it means the segment represents a single element, so store `arr[l]` in `segmentTree[i]`.
* Otherwise, split the segment into two halves:

  * Build left child on `[l, mid]`
  * Build right child on `[mid+1, r]`
* Then combine the results by summing the values of the two children to get the current nodeâ€™s value.

This way, each node stores the sum of its segment in the array.

Notice how at the bottom it is basically the original array itself, and now we are just building layers over it.
