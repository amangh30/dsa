# Why 4n Space?

### ðŸ§  The idea:

When building a segment tree for an array of size `n`, youâ€™re building a **binary tree** where:

* Each **leaf node** represents one element of the array.
* Each **internal node** represents a range sum (or min/max/whatever operation) of two child nodes.

---

### ðŸ§® Why 4 Ã— n?

* A **complete binary tree** storing `n` leaves (for an array of size `n`) may require up to **2 Ã— n â€“ 1** total nodes (in the worst case).
* But when implementing segment trees using **arrays**, we usually **preallocate space for up to 4 Ã— n** to be safe, especially for non-power-of-two sizes.

This is done because:

* For arrays of arbitrary size (not powers of 2), the tree becomes **unbalanced** or **not full**, and extra space ensures no overflow.
* The segment tree is stored in an array like a binary heap, where children of node `i` are `2i+1` and `2i+2`. This requires empty slots for irregular trees.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Example:

Letâ€™s say `n = 5`:

* A minimal binary tree would need 9 nodes (internal + leaf).
* But the next power of 2 is 8, and a complete segment tree for that could use up to `2*8 - 1 = 15` nodes.
* So we allocate `4 * 5 = 20` to be safe.

### âœ… Summary:

| Concept            | Value                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Leaf nodes         | `n`                                                  |
| Total nodes needed | `~2n`                                                |
| Safe allocation    | `4n`                                                 |
| Why?               | Irregular trees + array-based indexing needs padding |

In easier words, when n is not of power of two, we need to add dummy nodes so as we get a complete binary tree. We take 2n leaf nodes (padding) and therefore the whole segment array is of 4n size
