# Query Segment Tree

## How to search for a particular query


```cpp
int querySegmentTree(int start, int end, int i, int l, int r, vector<int>& segmentTree) {
        if(l > end || r < start) {
            return 0;
        }

        if(l >= start && r <= end) {
            return segmentTree[i];
        }

        int mid = l + (r-l)/2;
        return querySegmentTree(start, end, 2*i+1, l,    mid, segmentTree) +
               querySegmentTree(start, end, 2*i+2, mid+1, r, segmentTree);
    }
```

* **Out of range (`l > end` or `r < start`)**: Return `0` (no contribution).
* **Complete overlap (`[l, r]` within `[start, end]`)**: Return `segmentTree[i]`.
* **Partial overlap**: Split into left and right children, recursively query both, and sum the results.

This way, only the relevant segments are checked, keeping the query efficient.

### Query Segment Tree — Time & Space Complexity

#### ⏱ Time Complexity:

* In the worst case, the query may touch **O(log n)** nodes from root to leaves.
* In case of partial overlaps, it can visit **up to 2·log n** nodes.
* So, **time complexity is O(log n)**.

#### 💾 Space Complexity:

* No extra space used (excluding the call stack).
* **Space complexity is O(log n)** due to recursion stack depth.

**Summary:**

| Operation     | Complexity |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Query         | O(log n)   |
| Space (stack) | O(log n)   |
