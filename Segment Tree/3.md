# Segment Tree Update

## How to update Segment Tree if some element's value is updated


```cpp
int updateSegmentTree(int index, int val, int i, int l, int r, vector<int>& segmentTree){
    if(l == r){
        segmentTree[i] = val;
        return;
    }

    int mid = r + (l-r)/2;

    if(index<=mid){
        updateSegmentTree(index,val,2*i+1,l,mid,segmentTree);
    }
    else{
        updateSegmentTree(index,val,2*i+2,mid+1,r,segmentTree);
    }

    segmentTree[i] = segmentTree[2*i+1] + segmentTree[2*i+2];
}
```
* **Base case (`l == r`)**:
  We've reached the leaf node for the updated index — set it to `val`.

* **Recursive case**:

  * Compute `mid` and check which side the `index` lies on.
  * Recur into the correct child (left or right).

* **After recursion**:

  * Update the current node by summing its two children (to reflect the change).

This ensures all affected nodes in the path from leaf to root are updated.

### 🕒 Time and 💾 Space Complexity for `updateSegmentTree`

#### ⏱ Time Complexity:

* Only one path from the root to the updated leaf is traversed.
* The height of the segment tree is **O(log n)**.
* So, **time complexity = O(log n)**.

#### 💾 Space Complexity:

* Uses recursion, with a max call stack depth of **O(log n)**.
* So, **space complexity = O(log n)**.

**Summary:**

| Operation | Time     | Space    |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| Update    | O(log n) | O(log n) |
